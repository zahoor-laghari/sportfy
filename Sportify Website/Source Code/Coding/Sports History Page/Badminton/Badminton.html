  <section class="history-section">
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Badminton originated in British India during the mid-19th century and quickly became a popular sport worldwide. Played using racquets and a shuttlecock, it is a fast-paced game that demands agility, speed, and precision.
      <br><br>
      Matches are usually played indoors between singles or doubles, and players score by landing the shuttlecock in the opponent's court. Badminton is now a popular Olympic sport and has major followings in countries like China, Indonesia, India, Denmark, and South Korea.
