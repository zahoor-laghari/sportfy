    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Basketball is a team sport invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. It is now one of the most popular and widely viewed sports in the world. The game is played between two teams of five players each, aiming to score points by shooting a ball through a hoop.
      <br><br>
      The game is fast-paced, requiring athleticism, teamwork, and strategic play. Played on a rectangular court with a hoop at each end, the team with the most points at the end of four quarters wins.
