  <section class="history-section">
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Javelin throw is a track and field event where athletes compete to throw a spear-like implement called a javelin as far as possible. Originating from ancient hunting and warfare techniques, it has become a popular sport worldwide, especially in athletics competitions such as the Olympics and World Championships.
      <br><br>
      The event combines strength, speed, and technique, requiring athletes to run within a designated runway before launching the javelin into a marked sector. The thrower who achieves the longest valid throw wins the competition, highlighting the skillful balance between power and precision.
