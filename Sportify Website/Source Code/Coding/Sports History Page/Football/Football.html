    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
     Football, known as soccer in some countries, is the world's most popular sport with over 4 billion fans. Originating in England in the 19th century, the modern game has roots in various ball games played throughout history. The sport is governed by FIFA and features competitions like the World Cup, which is the most-watched sporting event globally.
      <br><br>
      Played between two teams of eleven players, the objective is to score by getting the ball into the opposing team's goal. Players primarily use their feet but can also use other parts of their body except their arms and hands (except for the goalkeeper). The game is known for its fast pace, skillful play, and passionate fan culture.
