    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Judo is a modern martial art, combat, and Olympic sport created in Japan in 1882 by Jigoro Kano. It evolved from jujutsu, emphasizing the principle of maximum efficiency with minimal effort. Today, Judo is practiced around the world as a competitive sport and a way to develop physical and mental discipline.
      <br><br>
      Judo matches take place on mats where two opponents attempt to throw, pin, or force a submission using grappling techniques. The sport emphasizes respect, control, and mutual welfare.
