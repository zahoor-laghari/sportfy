  <!-- History -->
  <section class="history-section">
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      Cricket is a bat-and-ball sport between two teams of eleven players each. It originated in England and is now one of the most popular sports in the world, especially in countries like Pakistan, India, Australia, England, South Africa, and Sri Lanka. The game is known for its spirit, strategy, and the unique balance between batting and bowling skills.
      <br><br>
      The playing field is oval-shaped with a rectangular 22-yard pitch in the center. Each team takes turns to bat and bowl. The batting team tries to score as many runs as possible while the bowling and fielding side tries to dismiss the batsmen. The team with the most runs at the end of the match wins.
